## upterm host

Host a terminal session

### Synopsis

Host a terminal session via a reverse SSH tunnel to the Upterm server, linking the IO of the host
and client to a command's IO. Authentication against the Upterm server defaults to using private key files located
at ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, and ~/.ssh/id_rsa. If no private key file is found, it resorts
to reading private keys from the SSH Agent. Absence of private keys in files or SSH Agent generates an on-the-fly
private key. To authorize client connections, specify a authorized_key file with public keys using --authorized-keys.

```
upterm host [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Host a terminal session running $SHELL, attaching client's IO to the host's:
  upterm host

  # Accept client connections automatically without prompts:
  upterm host --accept

  # Host a terminal session allowing only specified public key(s) to connect:
  upterm host --authorized-keys PATH_TO_AUTHORIZED_KEY_FILE

  # Host a session executing a custom command:
  upterm host -- docker run --rm -ti ubuntu bash

  # Host a 'tmux new -t pair-programming' session, forcing clients to join with 'tmux attach -t pair-programming':
  upterm host --force-command 'tmux attach -t pair-programming' -- tmux new -t pair-programming

  # Use a different Uptermd server, hosting a session via WebSocket:
  upterm host --server wss://YOUR_UPTERMD_SERVER -- YOUR_COMMAND
```
